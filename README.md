- 👋 Hi, I’m @xjlyt
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more in depth using Playwright for testing and also learn to be able to automate test suites to pipelines from scratch. Basically, to be able to implement the best practices to code for testing purposes.
  Here are some of the areas that I am interested in:
    -> API Testing
    -> Authentication
    -> Dialog boxes / Frames
    -> Locators
    -> Screenshots
    -> Downloads
    -> Navigations
    -> Assertions
    -> Actions
    -> TraceViewer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Playwright using JavaScript and would want to have good fundamentals in this area.
